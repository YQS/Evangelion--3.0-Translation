00:00:45 Pursuit squad, report the current positions of Units 02-Dash and 08.
00:00:56 Unit 02-Dash has achieved operational altitude. It is now within range of the targeted orbit. 
00:01:01 Unit 08 was unable to breach target orbital range due to insufficient altitude. 
??:??:?? Copy that. 
00:01:06 02-Dash will conduct a solo operation. 
00:01:11 Roger. Unit 08 will act as support. Transition shift to 7
00:01:09 Unit 02-Dash is beyond the point of recovery. It is breaching Area 88. 
00:01:16 Roger. Commence Operation UA
00:01:24 Roger. Unit 02-Dash will enter the final operational orbit. Deceleration in progress. 
00:01:27 Inducing a Stage 1 spark within all engines. 
??:??:?? Combustion imminent. 
00:01:34 S1C combustion complete. Deceleration confirmed
00:01:41 Jettisoning booster unit, stage 1
00:01:43 Confirmed, ascertaining visual status. 
??:??:?? We're all clear. 
00:01:47 Roger. Automating ignition timing. Igniting all engines, stage 2
00:01:56 S1C combustion complete. Closing pressure valves
00:01:57 Jettisoning booster unit, stage 2
00:02:00 Deceleration complete
00:02:02 Preparing to enter final operational orbit. Flipping unit  head. Commencing rotation. 
00:02:09 Descent angle confirmed to be within an acceptable range of error.
00:02:10 Recalculating relative velocity
??:??:?? No problems
00:02:16 Final orbit corrections complete
00:02:18 180-degree rotation complete
00:02:20 Roger. Unit 02-Dash will transition to the intersection orbit. Now commencing the operation
00:02:26 All remote guiding will now be cut. Unit will be controlled locally
00:02:30 Good luck
00:02:33 Unit is on course to intersect with the target. Eight miles until contact
00:02:38 Confirming target
00:02:39 Contact point is unchanged
00:02:40 Maintaining Shift-M. No problems
00:02:43 02-Dash, prepare to rendezvous. Unit 08 is lacking altitude, so it can only assist you in the 96 seconds until re-entry
00:02:50 Finish this by then
00:02:54 Reflective waves detected in target space. It's jamming us!
00:02:57 It's just the auto-defense system's mass weapon. No need to worry
00:03:02 Burst flows generated!
00:03:04 Incoming in 3... 2... 1...

Second wave incoming. Blood type: blue

A troublesome bunch

Identifying approaching body

Confirmed to be MK. 04A

Anti-A.T. field!

This sucks!

It's just getting in my way!

Favored four-eyes! Support me!

Support fire was 2 seconds late!

And you're 3 seconds ahead of position

It's called adapting to the situation. Keep up with me!

As you wish,

Princess!

Got through the Fraury Shift

I'll break into Final Defense Area 89

The target is moving!

No time to correct my orbit!

I'm going in!

Decelerate!

Eight!

Seven!

Six!

Five!

Four!

Three!

Two!

One!

Terminating combustion!

02-Dash has jettisoned the last boosters

Ensuring safety distance for re-entry

Successfully seized the target. Returning.

Roger

We'll be waiting at the retrieval point

The join code is Saturn 5

Roger

Blood type blue? Where?!

The triggering object is MK 04B

It's deploying indo-hashamas.

What nerve!

Right before re-entering too

Favored four-eyes, support me!

Sorry!

I don't have enough altitude, so c'ya!

I'll leave the rest to y-...

Ugh! She's useless!

Damn, this thing is stubborn!

Nobody told me about this!

What's with this light?!

The A.T. field isn't neutralizing it!

Gotta do a core block!

You're not getting away!

Crap! I can't maintain my descent angle!

My unit will break apart at this rate!

02-Dash, completing the mission is the utmost priority!

Don't let go of the target object, even if it means losing the unit itself

I already know that!

Stupid Shinji, do something!

Welcome back, Ikari Shinji-kun

I've been waiting for you

13:35 - とどめに、攻撃目標たるコアブロックも補足できない。つまり、現状での勝算は0です。
13:42 - ここはいつも通り撤退を。為す術が無いのよ。葛城艦長！
13:48 - だからこそ、現状を変えて後顧の憂いを断つ。区長、飛ぶわよ。
13:54 - 飛ぶ！？まさか、主機を使う気！？
13:58 - 全艦！発進準備！主機、点火準備
14:03 - いきなり本艦との実戦は無茶よ、葛城艦長！
14:06 - 同意します、試運転も無しに、危険すぎます！
14:11 - 重力制御は、未経験です。自信ありません。
14:14 - 勝てない戦は無しがいいな。アタシまだ死にたくないもん。
14:17 - 死ぬときゃ死ぬ、そんだけだ。若いもんが細かく言うな。
14:21 - ヴァーッ、年寄りなら慎重に行くもんでしょ。
14:25 - 無茶は承知！本艦を囮に、もう表を引きずり出します。
14:30 - 神 殺しの力、見極めるだけよ。
14:34 - しかし、肝心の点火システムは未設置なの。まさか、エヴァを使う気！？
14:40 - マリ！
14:00 - 8号機、まだ無理
14:42 - アスカ！
14:43 - アスカ？
14:46 - もうやってる。要は点火器をぶちこみゃいいんでしょ。
14:49 - 頼むわ
14:51 - しかし、主機周辺は結界密度の問題が。それに、艦橋作業中でしょ。

24:15 これが神殺しの＃＃＃ まさに希望の船ね。
25:00 検体 DM03、仮称 碇シンジさん、副長から説明があるそうです。
25:07 これが初号機
25:08 ええ、初号機は現在、本艦の主機として使用中。ゆえにパイロットは不要です。
25:17 Ah, so you I'm really not needed.
25:19 Also, your synchro test results have come back. The synchro rate is 0.00%.
25:26 Even if you were to board Eva, it would not start up.
25:31 Is that so? Isn't that good news, Ikari-san?
25:33 とはいえ、先に突如12秒間も、覚醒状態と化した事実は看過できない。
25:40 ゆえにあなたには、DSSチョーカーを装着させてあります。
25:45 なんですか、これ。
25:46 私達への保険。覚醒回避のための物理的安全装置。私達の不信と、あなたへの罰の象徴です。
25:55 どういう、ことですか。
25:57 エヴァ搭乗時、自己の感情に飲み込まれ、覚醒リスクを抑えられない事態に達した場合、あなたの一命をもって堰き止めるということです。
26:10 Does that mean... I will die?
26:14 I will not deny that.
26:17 No way...
26:19 Misato-san, what is this about dying? This is weird Misato-san! Suddenly it's all like this, I don't understand anything!
26:27 It can't be helped that you're confused. Second Lt.
26:29 Yes!
26:31 彼に官姓名を。
26:31 Right. Um, it's late, but I'm the medical officer in charge(? 管理担当医官). Second Lt Suzuhara Sakura. Nice to meet you. 
26:43 Ah, y-yes.
26:47 But, Suzuhara... Touji's? 
26:51 Ah, yes. You've helped my big brother. I'm his little sister Sakura. 
26:54 Little sister? Don't you mean big sister? 
26:58 Yes, his little sister. 
27:00 L-little sister...? How? 
27:05 14 years have passed since then. Stupid Shinji. 
27:09 Huh? Ah, Asuka! 
27:14 I'm so happy! You're safe, Asuka!
27:20 アゥッ
27:20 I can't stand this. I've been holding this in.
27:35 What was that about...
27:36 Built up anger and grief. 
27:40 What do you mean... Ah, Asuka, your left eye... 
27:44 It's got nothing to do with you.
27:45 Asuka. You said it's been 14 years, but the only thing that's changed about you is that eyepatch.
27:52 Right. It's the Eva's Curse. 
27:56 Curse? 
28:00 Wait! Asuka, maybe you know! Where's Ayanami?! 
28:06 I don't know. 
28:07 You don't know...? But I saved her! 
28:11 Worrying about just one person. This world doesn't have time to cater to your ego. Isn't that right, Col Katsuragi? 
28:23 Asuka!
28:24 Misato-san, where's Ayanami?! Please, tell me! 
28:27 Shinji-kun. Ayanami Rei no longer exists.
28:31 No, I saved her, I know I did. She must still be in Eva-01's plug. Please, search for her! 
28:38 We've already conducted a thorough sweep of Eva-01. We only found you.
28:45 And for some reason, this was restored. The inspection yielded no problems. We'll return it.(? 返還しておきます) 
28:52 My father's... Ayanami was holding it then. So I saved her, didn't I?
29:02 What?!
29:05 It's me!
29:07 目標 後甲板です。いきなり取り憑かれました。
29:09 本命のお出ましか。
29:11 全艦　第一種戦闘配置　初号機保護を最優先
29:15 8号機、もういけるんでしょ。
29:17 モチのロン。今やってるようにね。
29:20 By the way, how was the little pup? Is he obediently staying put?
29:26 何も変わらず、＃＃＃で馬鹿な顔してた。
29:29 その顔、見に行ったんじゃないの～？
29:32 違う！眺めに行っただけ！これでスッキリした。
29:36 Misato-san, Ritsuko-san! Just who is coming? Is it a new angel!?
29:41 Ikari-kun, where are you?
29:44 Ayanami. Just now, that was Ayanami's voice, wasn't it!? Misa-
29:53 What is up with this!?
29:55 Preparations complete! Ikari-san, this way!
29:59 Ikari-kun, where are you?
30:02 It really is Ayanami.
30:04 It's Ayanami!
30:07 Ikari-san! Quickly!
30:12 Enough with this. Ayanami, I'm right here!
30:29 Eva... unit 00.
30:31 Ikari-kun, come this way.
30:35 Don't do it Shinji-kun. Just stay put here.
30:39 What's with that Misato-san? Just before you were saying I was no longer needed!
30:44 Even so, we will keep you in custody here.
30:46 That's just too one sided!
30:54 Please stop it, the target is an Eva!
30:56 And that is exactly why. We will destroy all of NERV's Evas.
30:59 NERV...Isn't this NERV here too!?
31:03 We are WILLE, an organisation built to annihilate NERV.
31:08 That's...no, but Ayanami is the one piloting that!
31:13 She's not! Rei is no longer here, Shinji-kun.
31:16 Liar! I mean she is right here!
31:19 Misato-san you blockhead! I've had enough!
31:25 Ikari-san! Even if you leave, please just don't pilot an Eva!
31:32 ホンマ・・・勘弁してほしいわ
31:43 逃がすな、コネ メガネ！
31:44 合点承知！
31:53 的を～狙えば外さないよ～♪ ヘーイ カモーン
32:02 いよっしゃー！
32:10 やっぱし！ADAMSの器か？
32:18 ＃＃＃♪
32:23 The fact he was taken in priority over Unit 1 means he still has potential as a trigger! 
32:27 Misato! (use/take/etc.) The DSS choker! 
32:45 Mission directive from Executive Officer. Pursuit unnecessary. All personnel, resume emergency damage control and camouflage operation.
32:50 Roger. Resume emergency damage control and camoflouge operation
32:55 フンッ あれじゃあ、馬鹿じゃなく、ガキね
33:16 I did save her after all. Misato-san is a liar.
33:21 This way.
33:33 Um...
33:49 Even though this is GeoFront... you can see the sky.
34:01 Is that... NERV headquarters? What happened?
34:38 It really has been 14 years.
35:16 Here.
35:20 What's this? Eva...?
35:25 That's right.
35:28 Dad...
35:30 Evangelion unit 13, you and that pilot's unit.
35:38 The one on the piano just before?
35:42 When the time comes, pilot this Eva along with that boy. We are done talking.
35:48 Wait a second dad! I still have a lot of questions, a lot I want to talk about! Dad!
36:06 There's no dial tone, so I can't reach anyone from here.
36:32 I really should get going.
00:36:43 Ayanami~ 
00:36:47 Ayanami, where are you? 
00:36:51 Ayanami---- 
00:37:27 That's weird, this place is... Ayanami?! There you are！
00:37:36 I've been looking for you！Ah! Um. Ah, Wait... clothes! Put some clothes on! 
00:37:46 If that is an order, I will do it. 
00:37:49 I'm coming in... 
00:37:55 Um Ayanami, thank you. I've been wanting to thank you for a while. 
00:38:10 Your plugsuit got renewed. It suits you. Though black is a little...
00:38:22 NERV HQ has changed quite a lot hasn't it. 
00:38:29 Why is Misato fighting against NERV and not the Angels? 
00:38:32 What does father intend to do here? What's become of everyone? 
00:38:39 Hey, Ayanami, do you know anything? 
00:38:43 I do not. 
00:38:44 I see... Say, when did you return from Unit 01? 
00:39:00 This place isn't much of a room. You could say it's just your style, but it doesn't seem like there is school, so what do you do all the time? 
00:39:11 Wait. For orders. 
00:39:15 There are no books here. You're not reading any books? 
00:39:19 Books? Would Rei Ayanami read books? 
00:39:25 Yes. Doesn't she? She had books in her room... 
00:39:28 I see... 
00:39:31 I got it. I'll go look for some books in the library here and bring you some. 
00:39:35 Um, maybe English books? You always used to have one with you and seemed like you like them. 
00:39:41 Like... 
00:39:42 yeah... at least I think so. 
00:39:46 What is "like"? 
00:39:57 Is Rei still silent? 
00:40:01 Human instrumentality Project will be carried out according to the Dead Sea Scrolls. We no longer need to weave the story. 
00:40:09 Ikari, you plan to use Unit 13 this time? Whatever. I will follow your plan, for Yui. 
00:40:25 It's no use, it won't move.
00:40:36 Don't do anything. 
00:40:37 It has nothing to do with you. 
00:40:38 Please, just don't pilot the EVA! 
00:40:40 Get in the EVA. 
00:40:41 I don't know. 
00:41:37 Come down here, Ikari-kun, let's talk!
00:41:46 U-Uh, aren't we going to talk?
00:41:49 I wanted to talk about a possible duet on the piano. A dialogue of sounds. Why don't we try it?
00:41:58 Ah, it's fine. I can't do that.
00:41:57 If you want to live well, you have to change and try new things. 
00:42:09 Look, it's easy. You just have to hit this key here.  
00:42:28 Now, follow along with me. 
00:42:54 That sounds so nice. Each note is so pleasurable.
00:43:33 You're playing so well. We're amazing together, aren't we?
00:43:43 Thanks, it feels like it's been a while since I've had so much fun.
00:43:46 Me too. Let's meet again sometime. You can come whenever, Ikari Shinji-kun.
00:43:52 Yeah. Oh- Who are you?
00:43:56 I'm Kaworu, Nagisa Kaworu. I'm the same as you, a child chosen by fate.
00:44:10 She's still not here. The books are the same too. 
00:44:30 Good morning, Ikari Shinji-kun. You're here early today.
00:44:36 I don't really have anything else to do.
00:45:07 I wonder how I could play it better...
00:45:11 There is no need to play well. Just producing a pleasing sound will suffice.   
00:45:18 Then, I want to make it sound better, how do I do that?
00:45:22 Memorization and practice.　Doing it over and over until it feels good enough to you. That's the only way.
00:46:02 It's okay, leave it to me. Just move along.
00:46:05 Um, thank you. I feel bad for making you do so much for me.
00:46:12 You don't need to worry about that. We're friends.
??:??:?? Ah...
00:46:19 It's gotten quite dark, hasn't it? Why don't we head back for today?
00:46:23 Hey, why don't we stay here for a little longer? We could watch the stars lfrom here.
??:??:?? The stars...?
00:46:28 Do you like the stars?
00:46:34 Yeah, ever since I was little, it strikes me how large the universe is; I feel marginalized, but in a humbling way, and in my 14 years of life it hasn't changed a bit...it calms me down, if that makes sense. 
00:46:57 Ah, it's difficult to put it into words. 
00:46:59 Your feelings came through. You don't seek change, but rather desire stability in the world. It's like you.
00:47:09 It's nice, I didn't know that lying out here together could be so pleasant. Thanks for inviting me.
00:47:16 Oh, no you don't need to...I just thought that it'd be fun, if you wanted to, and-
00:47:25 It is fun. I really was born to meet you.
00:47:50 Hm? I wonder if it's still noticeable...
??:??:?? Huh?
00:48:00 Here, it should work now.
??:??:?? Thanks, you're amazing, Nagisa-kun. You can do everything.
00:48:08 This is just knowledge. it's because I've stayed in this world for a little longer than you.
00:48:15 But still...You're amazing.
00:48:19 You don't look too well. What's wrong?
00:48:26 I'm worried about my friends.
00:48:30 Friends?
00:48:31 Yes. Above NERV HQ there was a city. Everyone lived there. 
00:48:37 Touji, Kensuke, Prez, everyone...
00:48:42 Apparently I had been sleeping in Unit 01 for 14 years. I don't know what's changed in that time...
00:48:50 Not knowing the answer to that must be painful.
00:48:53 Somehow, I'm scared. Of what's happened to everyone, I'm scared of it for some reason. That's right, I'm scared!
00:49:16 Do you want to know?
00:49:45 Kaworu, Kaworu!


  (50:22) 
K: The clouds will disperse soon, and you will see the truth you desire.
S: What is this...? 
K: The result of Third Impact, which came to pass during your slumber in Eva-01. 
S: This is... What happened to everyone in the city? 
K: Mass extinction is not unusual on this planet. 
Rather, it is the aspect that drives evolution. 
Because life is fundamentally something that adjusts to the world and changes itself. 
However, Lilin do not change themselves, but the world. 
So they brought the rite of artificial evolution unto themselves. 
Old life is offered in sacrifice, to facilitate the birth of new beings blessed by the Fruit of Life.
This fateful cycle of destruction and rebirth is the product of archaic programming. 
NERV calls it the Human Instrumentality Project. 
  (51:38) 
S: This is Nerv's-- what my father was doing. 
K: Ikari Shinji-kun, once awakened, Eva-01 became the trigger for Third Impact and opened the Door of Guf. Lilin call it Near Third Impact. It was all initiated by you. 
S: You're wrong! All I did was save Ayanami! 
K: True, but that was the catalyst...
S: All this... I didn't know. You're telling me all of it so quickly, and there's nothing I can do about it! 
K: Indeed. There's nothing you can do about your past. 
The truth you desired to know. 
The Lilin are providing you reparation for your sin as a result. 
That's what your neck device is, no? 
S: What sin? I didn't do anything. I had nothing to do with it! 
  (52:50) 
K: If it wasn't you, then who was it?  
However, no sin is beyond redemption.
There is always hope. Always. 


01:04:38 Evangelion 13, start up! 
01:04:44 Signal coming in! [?] Activation of a new type of Eva confirmed. 
01:05:06 We're not alone. 
01:05:10 You mean the Mark.09? It's here as our backup. It will warn us to any Wille activity. 
01:05:15 [???] just us should be enough. It isn't even Ayanami... 
01:05:22 Not... Ayanami? 
01:05:28 Bones? [?] 
01:05:30 Yes, all of the failures of infinity. Don't let them weigh upon your mind. 
01:05:42 We're nearly at Lilith's barrier. The Main Shaft is completely blocked, keeping anyone from intruding over the past 14 years. 
01:05:56 [???] 
01:06:00 It's all right. Eva-13 was made for breaking through this. The two of us can do it. 
01:06:15 Try to join tempos. Remember the piano duet. 
01:06:24 Let's go, Shinji-kun. 
01:06:48 We did it! 
01:07:07 We've arrived. The deepest part of Central Dogma. The epicenter of Third Impact. 
01:07:21 Is this Lilith? 
01:07:23 What had once been. It is her corpse. 
01:07:27 Misato-san [can't make out rest]. Uh.... That's an Eva? 
01:07:35 Yes, the Eva Mark.06. Remodeled into an independent type, exploitation by the Lilin brought the unit to a state of ruin.
